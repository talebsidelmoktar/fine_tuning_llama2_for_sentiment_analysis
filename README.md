# Fine-Tuning LLaMA 2 for Sentiment Analysis

## Overview
This notebook demonstrates how to fine-tune LLaMA 2 for sentiment analysis. The fine-tuning process involves adapting the pre-trained LLaMA 2 model to classify text as positive, negative, or neutral based on a given dataset. The implementation leverages Hugging Face's `transformers` library and `PEFT` (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning) methods such as LoRA to optimize training efficiency.

## Dataset
The dataset used for fine-tuning consists of labeled text samples for sentiment classification. Common datasets include:
- IMDb Reviews (Movie reviews classified as positive or negative)
- SST-2 (Stanford Sentiment Treebank, binary classification)
- Financial PhraseBank (Sentiment analysis for financial texts)

The dataset is preprocessed by tokenizing the text using LLaMA 2’s tokenizer and formatting it into a suitable format for training.

## Requirements
Before running the notebook, install the necessary dependencies:
```bash
pip install torch transformers peft datasets accelerate bitsandbytes
```

Ensure that you have access to Meta’s LLaMA 2 model, which may require obtaining appropriate permissions from Meta’s official repository.

## Fine-Tuning Process
1. **Load Pretrained Model & Tokenizer**: Load LLaMA 2 with the corresponding tokenizer from Hugging Face.
2. **Preprocess Data**: Tokenize and format the dataset into input tensors.
3. **Apply PEFT (LoRA)**: Reduce training overhead by applying LoRA to fine-tune only specific layers.
4. **Train the Model**: Use `Trainer` from `transformers` or a custom PyTorch training loop.
5. **Evaluate Performance**: Compute accuracy, F1-score, and loss on the validation set.
6. **Save & Export Model**: Save the fine-tuned model for inference.



## Results & Evaluation
After training, the model's performance is evaluated using standard sentiment analysis metrics:
- **Accuracy**
- **F1-score**
- **Precision & Recall**

Results are visualized using Matplotlib or Seaborn for loss and accuracy trends during training.
